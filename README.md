# Stock prices prediction

This program takes the stock prices of Apple from Jan 2010 to Oct 2019, and then based on the trends in the historical data, aims to predict the trends for the following two months, Nov 2019 and Dec 2019. These predicted prices are then compared against the real stock prices from Nov 2019 and Dec 2019, and a visualization is made to compare both sets.

Stock prices were taken from Yahoo Finance.

A Recurrent Neural Networ (RNN) was used to make the model.
